MY SANS SEC275 Python code documentation

This repository will house all my codes I am using to learn Python language from scratch. This is part of SANS SEC 275 Course  taught by James Lyne, SANS CTO to give an introduction to Computers, Programming and Cybersecurity. 

Hopefully, at the end of this course, I will be comfortable using Python to write basic scripts and commands to execute some tasks as a cybersecurity professional and automate DevOps tasks. 

Bless up.
